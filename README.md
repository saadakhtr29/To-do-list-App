<h2>Overview</h2>
<li> <b>HTML Structure:</b> The project uses a basic HTML structure with a head section containing metadata, a title, and links to an external stylesheet (index.css) and a favicon (icon.png).
<li> <b>Body Content:</b> The body section contains a div with a class of container, which wraps the entire application. Inside, there's a div with a class of todo-app, which contains the main application components.
<li> <b>Header:</b> The application has a simple header with an h2 element displaying the title "To-Do List" accompanied by an image (the same icon used as the favicon).
<li> <b>Input and Button:</b> Below the header, there's a div with a class of row containing an input field with a placeholder text "Add your text" and an "Add" button. This suggests that users can input new tasks and add them to the list.
<li> <b>Task List:</b> The application has an empty ul element with an ID of list-container, which will likely be populated with task items dynamically using JavaScript.
<li> <b>JavaScript:</b> The project includes a script tag linking to an external JavaScript file (index.js), which will likely contain the logic for adding tasks, updating the list, and handling user interactions.
